# Disease_Predictor
I have developed a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having three different types of diseases: diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. To achieve the highest accuracy, I experimented with various machine learning models.

To make the model accessible and user-friendly, I deployed it using Streamlit. Streamlit is an easy-to-use framework that seamlessly integrates with the Python ecosystem. It allows for rapid prototyping, interactive visualizations, and responsive user interfaces.

For my ML model, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle, a popular website for data science and ML providing wide range of datasets

I have even incorporated additional images that are linked to the respective diseases. These images provide visual cues and make the app more engaging and informative.
