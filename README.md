A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of three different types of diseases: diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. :hospital:

ðŸ”¬ To achieve the highest accuracy, I experimented with various machine learning models. :test_tube:

ðŸš€ To make the model accessible and user-friendly, I deployed it using Streamlit. Streamlit is an easy-to-use framework that seamlessly integrates with the Python ecosystem. It allows for rapid prototyping, interactive visualizations, and responsive user interfaces. :computer:

ðŸ“Š The dataset for the model was collected from Kaggle, a popular website for data science and machine learning, providing a wide range of datasets. :bar_chart:

ðŸŒŸ Additionally, I have incorporated images linked to the respective diseases. These images provide visual cues and make the app more engaging and informative. :camera:
